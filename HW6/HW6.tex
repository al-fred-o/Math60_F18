Section 6.1 \#34. Tom Sawyer is whitewashing a picket fence. The bases of the fenceposts are arranged in the $xy$-plane as the quarter circle $x^2 + y^2 = 25, x, y \geq 0$, and the height of the fencepost at point $(x, y)$ is given by $h(x, y) = 10 - x - y$ (units are feet). Use a scalar line integral to find the area of one side of the fence. (See Figure 6.16.)\\

\begin{problem}
Section 6.1 \#40. You are traveling through Cleveland, famous for its lake-effect snow in winter that makes driving quite treacherous. Suppose that you are currently located 20 miles due east of Cleveland and are attempting to drive to a point 20 miles due west of Cleveland. Further suppose that if you are $s$ miles from the center of Cleveland, where the weather is the worst, you can drive at a rate of at most $v(s) = 2s + 20$ miles per hour.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[(a)] How long will the trip take if you drive on a straight-line path directly through Cleveland? (Assume that you always drive at the maximum speed possible.)
	\item[(b)] How long will the trip take if you avoid the middle of the city by driving along a semicircular path with Cleveland at the center? (Again, assume that you drive at the maximum speed possible.)
	\item[(a)] Repeat parts (a) and (b), this time using $v(s) = (s^2 / 16) + 25$ miles per hour as the maximum speed that you can drive.

\begin{problem}
Section 7.2 \#28. The glass dome of a futuristic greenhouse is shaped like the surface $ z = 8 - 2x^2 - 2y^2 $. The greenhouse has a flat dirt floor at $z = 0$. Suppose that the temperature $T$, at points in and around the greenhouse, varies as
$$ T(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + 3(z-2)^2. $$
Then the temperature gives rise to a \textbf{heat flux density field $\mathbf{H}$} given by $\mathbf{H} = -k \nabla T$. (Here $k$ is a positive constant that depends on the insulating properties of the particular medium.) Find the total heat flux outward across the dome and the surface of the ground if $k = 1$ on the glass and $k = 3$ on the ground.
